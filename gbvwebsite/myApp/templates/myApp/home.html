    <div class="container">
        <h2>Definition of GBV</h2>
        <p>Gender-Based Violence (GBV) refers to harmful acts directed at an individual based on their gender. It encompasses a range of physical, sexual, and psychological abuses, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, rape, and cultural practices like female genital mutilation (FGM).</p>

        <h2>Prevalence of GBV in Tanzania</h2>
        <p>GBV is a significant issue in Tanzania. According to the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), approximately 40% of ever-married women have experienced physical violence from their partners, and about 17% of women aged 15-49 have experienced sexual violence. Despite being illegal, FGM remains a practice in some regions, with prevalence rates as high as 70%.</p>

        <h2>Contributing Factors</h2>
        <p>Several factors contribute to the high rates of GBV in Tanzania, including cultural norms and beliefs, economic dependency, legal and institutional challenges, and stigma and fear of reporting abuses.</p>

        <h2>Impact of GBV</h2>
        <p>GBV has severe consequences on the physical and mental health of survivors, economic repercussions, and social impacts that undermine social cohesion and development.</p>

        <h2>Efforts to Address GBV</h2>
        <p>Efforts to combat GBV in Tanzania include strengthening the legal framework, government initiatives, NGO and community efforts, and international support. However, challenges such as cultural resistance, resource constraints, and coordination issues remain.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Addressing GBV in Tanzania requires a multifaceted approach that includes changing cultural attitudes, empowering women economically, and ensuring access to justice for all. Sustained and coordinated efforts are essential to make significant strides in reducing and ultimately eliminating GBV.</p>
